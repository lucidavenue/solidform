                            Because customizing an existing piece of software can be much faster and cheaper than developing a new one from scratch we at SolidForm help you re-imagine old software and bring it up to date with the latest technology standards. In addition, customizing an existing piece of software gives us a chance to explore new possibilities and add new functionality that the original creators may not have anticipated. As a result, an updated piece of software can help you to stay competitive in the marketplace and even surpass newer alternatives.

                            In case you are searching for a custom software solution, then you may want to consider having your application running as an Application service or binary daemon application on a Virtual Machine. This will allow for seamless integration with your company's Active Directory, giving you full control over the application. Additionally, this option gives you the flexibility to run the application either locally or on your company's virtual cloud. If you choose to run the application on a Virtual Machine, you can utilize either the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or the Platform as a service (PaaS). Both options offer benefits that can help you get the most out of your custom software solution.

                            In custom software development, one of the main goals is to be able to quickly and efficiently provide virtual machines, deploy automated tools, and have fast and efficient build and deployment pipelines. This goal is achieved through continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). CI/CD pipelines allow for quick turnaround times when new code is pushed, as well as easy rollbacks in the event that something goes wrong. They also provide a consistent environment for testing, so that bugs can be found and fixed more quickly. In addition, CI/CD pipelines allow for automatic provisioning of new servers and databases, so that custom software development teams can focus on their core strengths: writing code. As a result, CI/CD is an essential part of custom software development.

                            Automated testing is a vital part of custom software development. By automating the testing process, we can ensure that every build/version of your software is fully tested with all the relevant scenarios. This helps improve the quality of your software and makes it easier to identify and fix bugs. Our automated test suites are based on automation tools such as Selenium. Selenium is a widely used tool for web application testing, and it offers a wide range of features to make automated testing easier. It also has good support for custom extensions, making it easy to add new features to our automated test suites.  As a result, our clients can be confident that their products are of the highest quality before they are released to the public.
